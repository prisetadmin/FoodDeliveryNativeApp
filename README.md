This repository contains the source code for **Great Southern Food**, a fully functional, native mobile food delivery application for both iOS and Android.

The entire project—from the initial architecture and database schema to the front-end components and back-end logic—was generated autonomously by **Priset**, our AI engineering partner, from a single high-level prompt.

## 🚀 Generated by Priset: The 30-Minute Challenge

This repository serves as a public case study to demonstrate the power of autonomous, AI-driven software development. The goal was to test Priset's ability to create a complex, real-world application from scratch.

### The Prompt:
> *"Create a native mobile app for my restaurant named 'Great Southern Food' that will show the food menu, take orders and track deliveries. Provide sample data with beautiful pictures. Use node.js and SQLite database for the server. Create separate directories for client and server."*

### The Result:
In **30 minutes** of autonomous work, Priset:
1.  Architected a scalable solution using React Native.
2.  Generated the complete project structure, including all necessary files and dependencies.
3.  Wrote the code for all core features: user login, restaurant browsing, cart management, order delivery tracking.
4.  Created the backend functions and API interface.
5.  Produced clean, consistent, and production-ready code.

This project showcases how Priset can collapse weeks of manual development into minutes, freeing engineers to focus on vision and innovation. **[Learn more about Priset at priset.ai](https://www.priset.ai)**.
